# 🕶️ ARCH-STRIKE – The Pentesting Environment You Didn't Know You Needed

> "Stay anonymous. Stay dangerous."

---

## ⚡ What is this?

This is not your grandpa's dotfiles.
This is ARCH-STRIKE – a fully automated, cyberpunk‑styled Arch Linux environment built for:

- 🎯 Penetration testing
- 🧩 CTF competitions (HTB, TryHackMe, PicoCTF)
- 💻 Daily driving with smooth Hyprland eye candy
- 🔥 Flexing on your friends with terminal vibes

Everything is powered by Hyprland (Wayland) + BlackArch tools + a truckload of Nerd Fonts.

---

## 🚀 One‑shot installation (the only way)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kon-kyoto/arch_config.git
cd arch_config
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

What it does:
- ✅ Installs yay + paru (AUR helpers)
- ✅ Installs every package from packages.txt (Hyprland, Waybar, kitty, fonts, dev tools, etc.)
- ✅ Copies your .config folder into ~/.config/
- ✅ Optionally installs CyberGRUB‑2077 and SilentSDDM themes
- ✅ Optionally adds BlackArch repo and installs pentest-packages.txt (nmap, metasploit, john, beef, sqlmap, etc.)
- ✅ Enables libvirtd for your VM needs

> ⚠️ DO NOT RUN AS ROOT – the script will refuse to run. Run as a normal user with sudo privileges.

|------|-------------------|
| `nmap` | Network discovery & OS fingerprinting |
| `metasploit` | Exploit dev & payload delivery |
| `john` / `hydra` | Password cracking & brute force |
| `sqlmap` | Automatic SQL injection |

## 🎮 Post‑installation

1. Reboot when the script asks you.
2. Log into Hyprland (SDDM should look like SilentSDDM).
3. If you see GRUB looking like Cyberpunk 2077 – you made it.

---

## 🧠 Manual tweaks you might want

- Edit ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf to adjust keybinds, monitors, animations.
- Edit ~/.config/waybar/config if you want a different status bar layout.
- Your pentest tools live in BlackArch – run sudo pacman -S blackarch-<category> to get more.

## ❓ FAQ

Q: Why so many fonts?
A: Because terminal emulators deserve to look like a hacker movie.

Q: Can I run this on an existing Arch install?
A: Yes, but back up your dotfiles first. The script overwrites ~/.config/.

Q: BlackArch mirror is slow / down?
A: The script tries 10+ mirrors automatically. If all fail – check your internet.

Q: I don't want pentest tools.
A: Just answer n when it asks "Install pentest OS?".

Q: I want MORE tools.
A: Edit `pentest-packages.txt` or run `sudo pacman -S blackarch-<toolname>`.
